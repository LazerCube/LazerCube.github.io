description: Originally started as a college python project to develop my programming skills but has grown to become a project that I love coming back and improving on. It was used to display my ability to work through a complex project and to learn something new, in this case the graphics libary Pygame.
summary: A simple asteroid game written in Python 2.7 using the graphics libary Pygame.
