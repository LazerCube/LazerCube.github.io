## About

Was written as part of a web server scriping module while I was a college and had to meet this specification:

- Implement a simple login system using web server scripting.
- Implement a web content management system that is able to do the following utilities in the numbered list below:
    1. View
    2. Add a new (user)
    3. Edit a user
    4. Delete a user
    5. Form validation (eg check password has at least one number and isn't a simple word)
    6. Filtering (based on Role Student/Admin)
- Implement Access rights to pages depending on the user login. e.g. administrator, operator, and/or visitor
