summary: Social networking website written in python using the Django framework.
about: Created when I was first learning Django and web design, this simple social network allowed me to learn about python packages, AJAX request and gain a good understanding of the underlying code and methodologies behind most modern websites, including MVC, RESTful APIâ€™s (Which I would proceed to explore further) and data normalization.
