description: Created as a successor to my previous social network project with the aim of learning more about Rest APIâ€™s and their various authentication techniques. It was also used to help develop my skills on the front-end by creating a twin project, using originally angular2 and later vue.js, to utilize it.
summary: Social network REST API written using the Django Rest framework.
