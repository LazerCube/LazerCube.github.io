# Introduction

I'm a full stack web developer currently living and working in Hampshire. On this site you'll be able to find out more about what I've done, current projects, my services and me.

I love learning ways to utilise new web & desktop technologies and Iâ€™m comfortable developing on the frontend and backend as well as settings up or managing infrastructure.

Check out my Github profile!

You can see some of the things I've worked on over my [project page](/Projects) and my [Github](https://github.com/LazerCube).

There are a couple of ongoing projects stored and updated on there that you can either download and use or learn from.
