# Introduction

I'm a Web Developer and Programmer currently living and studying Computer Science at Swansea University. On this site you'll be able to find out more about what I've done, current projects, my services and me.

I primarily use **Python**, but picking up a new framework or language isn’t a problem. I love learning ways to utilise new web & desktop technologies and I’m comfortable developing on the frontend or backend as well as settings up or managing infrastructure.

Check out my Github profile!

You can see some of the things I've worked on over my [project page](/Projects) and my [Github](https://github.com/LazerCube).

There are a couple of ongoing projects stored and updated on there that you can either download and use or learn from.
