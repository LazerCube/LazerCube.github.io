# Introduction

My name is Elliot Lunness and I am a web and software developer. On this site you'll be able to find out more about what I've done, current projects, my services and me.

I've taught myself a variety of programming languages over the past 7 years including C#, Java, HTML5, Javascript, CSS3, PHP and SQL. I love learning new ways to utilise with web & desktop technologies and I'm always looking to create functions and code snippets that will improve the way we interact with applications.

### Can we hire you?

If you’re interested in recruiting me for your business, or contracting me out to create something on your behalf, I’m located in the South of England. I’m willing to travel to a degree if required (income-allowing) and would prefer to work remotely if that’s a possibility for your business.

### Github

Check out my Github profile!

There are a couple of ongoing projects stored and updated on there that you can either download and use or learn from.

Most of the projects I'm actively working on are self hosted private repositories.
